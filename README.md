The program finds the reversible first 10 squared prime numbers and
prints them out.
It finds the reversible squared prime numbers by:
1)Determines the prime number through the function  then,
It squares the prime number and makes it's reverse.
2)Then, it checks whether the squared prime number and
the reversed squared version of the number are palindrome.
3) After checking whether the number is a palindrome or not,
It prints the irreversible squared prime number.

The uploaded program is written I C language then I wrote 
the equivalent code of the C program in Assembly language. 
Then the last file is the machine code equivalent of the Assembly code.
